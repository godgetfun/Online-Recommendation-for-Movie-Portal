# Online-Recommendation-for-Movie-Portal

1. Abstract

Which movie I should watch tonight? Ever wonder how difficult this question could be if someone asks you to recommend the best movie? Best in terms of what? How this best is defined?
MOVIES fascinate every individual despite of his religion, age, zone, sex, and taste. Due to infinitely large number of movie options available for a user of specific taste, it is of utmost importance to develop a system that could recommend best movie (suited most to user preference). Many such systems have already been developed. But some of them recommend movies of a certain genre while some of them could not recommend to cold-start user. In this project, we aim to develop a system which is best in itself in terms of recommending as it is taking average value from available sources as well as user present needs and taste. Not only this but also, by taking average value, the cases of fraud ratings of already rated sites become lower in our recommendation, making it more reliable than present existing ones.

2. Introduction

In this dynamic world, where too much of information is available which keeps changing and increasing every minute, choosing domain of available options is indeed very large. Due to abundance of data floating everywhere, choosing one that is best suited to meet our demands and preferences is most times a very tedious job. Not only is this but it time consuming also. Therefore if we could rely on a system who can do this task for us and that too with accepted amount of accuracy, is definitely be a boon not only for problem solving in general, but also for specific individual in particular. Recommender system is the key.
Recommender systems are an important part of the information and e-commerce ecosystem. Whenever we talk of data which is exponentially large in comparison to a relatively small subset of options that are of interest, recommender system have always proved its existence. Recommender system takes input from user (say preferences, taste, necessity etc.), apply some apt algorithm on it and produce the recommender output for distinct user. Our recommendation engine will not only be based on available ratings but also on the distinct taste of individual user.
•	Taking of various options available, the first question that arises is why movies only? 
The answer to this question lies on the fact that every individual despite of age, zone, sex, taste needs ENTERTAINMENT.

Why movie recommendation is the need of the hour?
•	Preferably very large number of choices available.
•	Drastically reduces the domain of choices.
•	Movies guarantee entertainment (attracts user of all age groups).
•	How our system is superior to the ones already existing?
•	“MAKE IN INDIA” approach.
•	More reliable dataset and in turn more accurate outcome.
•	Can deal with fake ratings.


3. Problem Definition and Objectives

Why to depend on foreign movies dataset to produce movie Recommendation system algorithms?
•	We will have complete Indian movies dataset where user can login and rate movies of their choices.
•	We will also use ratings provided by different websites to produce collaborative rating for the recommendation-minimal false recommendation.
•	Using the above information and applying algorithms for predicting rating, top movies will be recommended to the users.
Objectives:-

•	Build dataset for Movie Recommender System.
•	Choice of Algorithm for predicting ratings :-
o	Cosine similarity method to find similar users.
o	Matrix factorization techniques.
