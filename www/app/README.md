An-Online-Social-Network-based-Recommendation-System
====================================================
We have built an online Movie Recommender System which is based on the analysis of users' ratings history to several movies and their demographic information. We used data from Movielens website. Collaborative filtering and matrix factorization techniques have been used for the implementation. The end result is a web application where a user is recommended with top 20 movies.
